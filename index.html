        <p>Arizona, a state in the southwest of the USA, is known for the Grand Canyon, a kilometers deep slit carved by the Colorado River. Flagstaff, a mountainous city covered with pine trees of the ponderous pine species, is an important access point to the Grand Canyon. Another prominent natural place is the Saguaro National Park, which protects the cactus-filled landscape of the Sonoran Desert. Tucson is a territory of the University of Arizona and is home to the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum.</p>
